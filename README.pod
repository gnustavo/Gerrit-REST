Gerrit::REST - A thin wrapper around Gerrit's REST API

CAUTION - THIS IS STILL ALPHA CODE

"L<Gerrit|https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/> is a web based code
review system, facilitating online code reviews for projects using the
Git version control system."

This module is a thin wrapper around L<Gerrit's REST
API|http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.6/rest-api.html>,
which is superseding it's old L<SSH
API|http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.6/cmd-index.html>,
for which there is another Perl module called
L<Gerrit::Client|http://search.cpan.org/dist/Gerrit-Client/>.
